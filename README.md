# **Basic Routing Protocols Implementation**

---

## **1. Introduction**

This project demonstrates the setup and configuration of three primary routing protocols—**RIP, EIGRP, and OSPF**—in a simulated network environment using Packet Tracer. The goal is to provide practical understanding of how routers communicate and exchange routing information efficiently.

---

## **2. Routing Protocols Overview**

### **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**

* A simple distance-vector protocol.
* Uses **hop count** as the metric for path selection.
* Best suited for **small networks**.

### **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)**

* Advanced distance-vector protocol with **fast convergence**.
* Uses **bandwidth, delay, load, and reliability** as metrics.
* Efficient for **medium to large networks**.

### **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**

* Link-state protocol using the **Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm**.
* Divides networks into **areas** for better scalability.
* Ideal for **large and complex networks**.

---

## **3. Configuration**

* **RIP:** Enable RIP on routers and advertise connected networks.
* **EIGRP:** Enable EIGRP with an **autonomous system number** and advertise networks.
* **OSPF:** Enable OSPF, assign **router IDs**, and advertise networks under the correct areas.

---

## **4. Objectives**

* Learn **basic command-line router configuration**.
* Understand the differences between **RIP, EIGRP, and OSPF**.
* Verify connectivity and routing tables using **Packet Tracer simulation**.

---

## **5. Files Included**

* Packet Tracer file (`.pkt`) containing configured routers, switches, and hosts.

If you want, I can also **turn this into a professional one-page PDF layout** with headings, table formatting for protocols, and embedded image for a project submission-ready version. Do you want me to do that?
