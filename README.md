Project Title: Basic Routing Protocols Implementation
1. Introduction

This project demonstrates the setup and configuration of three primary routing protocols—RIP, EIGRP, and OSPF—in a simulated network environment using Packet Tracer. It aims to provide hands-on understanding of how routers communicate and share routing information.

2. Routing Protocols Overview

RIP (Routing Information Protocol):

A simple distance-vector protocol.

Uses hop count as the metric for path selection.

Suitable for small networks.

EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol):

Advanced distance-vector protocol with faster convergence.

Uses bandwidth, delay, load, and reliability as metrics.

Efficient for medium to large networks.

OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):

Link-state protocol using the shortest path first algorithm.

Divides network into areas for better scalability.

Suitable for large and complex networks.

3. Configuration

RIP: Enable RIP on routers and advertise connected networks.

EIGRP: Enable EIGRP with an autonomous system number and advertise networks.

OSPF: Enable OSPF, assign router IDs, and advertise networks under proper areas.

4. Objectives

Learn basic command-line router configuration.

Understand differences between RIP, EIGRP, and OSPF.

Verify connectivity and routing tables using Packet Tracer.
